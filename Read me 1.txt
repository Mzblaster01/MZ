C++ Code - File Handling and Various Examples
This repository contains several C++ code snippets showcasing different features such as complex number multiplication, template classes, and file handling. Below are explanations for each part of the code.

Code Breakdown
1. Complex Number Multiplication
This code demonstrates the use of operator overloading in C++ to multiply complex numbers. The complex class has two constructors to initialize real and imaginary parts of complex numbers. The operator* method is overloaded to perform the multiplication of two complex numbers.

Key Concepts:

Class constructors
Operator overloading
2. Template Function: GetMax
This code defines a template function GetMax that takes two arguments and returns the maximum value between them. It works for both int and long types.

Key Concepts:

Template functions
Conditional operator (?:)
3. Template Class: MyPair
This code defines a template class mypair with two private data members and a method to return the maximum of the two values. The template is then instantiated for int types.

Key Concepts:

Template classes
Member functions
4. Template Class with Multiple Methods (GetMin and GetMax)
This code defines a template class mypair with two methods: getmin and getmax. The class can return either the minimum or the maximum value between two given values. It demonstrates how to use multiple methods in a template class.

Key Concepts:

Template classes
Member functions for min and max
5. Template Class with Array and Methods
This code defines a template class mysequence that works with arrays of various types. The class allows setting and getting values from the array, as well as finding the minimum and maximum values in the sequence.

Key Concepts:

Template classes with fixed array sizes
Array manipulation
Min/Max calculation
6. File Handling: Copy and Count Characters
This code demonstrates basic file handling in C++ where it reads content from a file (fin.txt) and writes the content to another file (fout.txt). It also counts the number of characters in the source file and writes that count to the output file.

Key Concepts:

File I/O (input/output)
Character counting
Writing to files
Example Files:
fin.txt: Input text file (must exist before running the program).
fout.txt: Output text file where the content of fin.txt will be copied, and the character count will be appended.
